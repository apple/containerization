> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan to make substantial changes or add new features, we encourage you to first discuss them with the wider containerization developer community.

> This will save time and increases the chance of your pull request being accepted.

We use a "squash and merge" strategy to keep our `main` branch history clean and easy to follow. When your pull request
is merged, all of your commits will be combined into a single commit.

With the "squash and merge" strategy, the *title* and *body* of your pull request is extremely important. It will become the commit message
for the squashed commit. Think of it as the single, definitive description of your contribution.

Before merging, we'll review the pull request title and body to ensure it:

*   Clearly and concisely describes the changes.
*   Uses the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature," "Fix bug").
*   Provides enough context for future developers to understand the purpose of the change.

The pull request description should be concise and accurately describe the *what* and *why* of your changes.
